# Scratch3_BalloonPop
Another Scratch 3 game
In this small game balloons move around at random. When clicked the ballooh hides, and 'pop' sound plays.

Start with a background:

![Background](https://github.com/zleap/Scratch3_BalloonPop/blob/master/backgroundBP.png) 


Now add a Balloon Sprite:


![enter image description here](https://github.com/zleap/Scratch3_BalloonPop/blob/master/baloonBP.png)


Now add the code to the Balloon Sprite:

![BalloonSprite](https://github.com/zleap/Scratch3_BalloonPop/blob/master/baloon1.png)

When the green flag is clicked, the balloon glides to a random position.  If it touches the edge of the stage then it will bounce off and head in another direction.

If the balloon is clicked then 'pop' is played and the sprite is hidden.

Now we have this working,  go ahead and add more balloons, copy the code over to each of the new balloons.

**EXTENSION KEEPING SCORE**

Can you add more blocks to keep score?  You will need a variable called **score**. 
If you need help with variables please take a look at my 
[timer project](https://github.com/zleap/scratch3_timer)

**ADD SCORE**

After creating a new variable, add the following code blocks to the project.
